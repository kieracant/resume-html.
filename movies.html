<h1>Objectively the best movies</h1>
<h2>Top 5.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Notting hill</h3>
<p>A truly beautiful reminder that even the meanest, most unhinged version of a person is capable of being loved and forgiven.<br />Changed my brain chemistry at the ripe age of 14.</p>
<h3>2. Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Corny. Romantic. Nuanced. Silly. <br /> The best comfort movie.</p>
<h3>3. Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Genuinely a schizo movie. Loved it.<br /> 10/10. </p>
<h3>4. The Big Lebowski </h3>
<p>I literally died it's the funniet movie ever</p>
<h3>5. Gone Girl</h3>
<p>She is me. <br />I am her.<br />We are one.</p>
<h3>HONOURABLE MENTION:</h3>
<p>Pearl - same as Gone Girl. Every insane woman in media is a representation of my soul</p>
